/**
 * Case studies.
 *
 * `published: true` is the gate: only published entries are prerendered to
 * static HTML, listed in the sitemap, and served at /work/<slug>. Leave a draft
 * at `false` and it never reaches the build output, the index, or production.
 *
 * Entries containing "TODO" are refused by the build even if `published` is
 * true, so an unfinished draft can never ship by accident.
 *
 * Set `published: true` only when the entry has real content, client permission
 * to show the work, and results you can stand behind. Attribute any figure the
 * client reported rather than measured — see the `note` field on `results`.
 *
 * Voice: the site speaks as "we" throughout. Client testimonial quotes are the
 * one exception — those are the client's own words and stay untouched apart
 * from light grammar fixes, which are recorded in a comment above each quote.
